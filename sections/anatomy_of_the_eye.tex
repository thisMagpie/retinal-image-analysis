\section{Light Sensitivity}

Certain cones of the eye are sensitive to particular frequencies of light.
A healthy/normal eye will pick up the full spectrum of colours. Colour blindness
occurs when cones which are sensitive to specific frequencies are abnormal, this
is more common in men than women because [of something to do with the X
chromosome\cite{gardner2010x} \ref{fig:wavelengths} shows normalised absorbance
against wavelength for red, green and blue cones of the eye.

Cones are not particularly sensitive to light but they aid to visual acuity
[citation needed] If all the eye cones are not working then this can cause
blindness to occur [citation needed]
