\section{The Cornea}

The cornea has a mean refractive index of around 1.4 (about the same as water) which means it is fairly transparent and allows plenty of light to pass through.\cite{thoft1983x, patel1994refractive}.

\Eref{eq:refractive} shows Snell's Law of refraction for a light wave passing
through two different isotropic materials which have refractive indices $n_1$ and $n_2$, respectively.
The angle $\theta_1$ is normal to the boundary between $n_1$ and $n_2$ and the angle $\theta_2$ is normal to the boundary between $n_2$ and $n_1$.

\begin{equation}
n_1\sin\theta_1=n_2\sin\theta_2
\label{eq:refractive}
\end{equation}



The outermost surface of the cornea is made of epithelial cells which
are continually lost and replaced.\cite{jester1999cellular,hassell2010molecular}
The reproduction of cells is facilitated in part by the tear ducts of the eye which  serve to moisten the \todo{something} and remove harmful bacteria.\cite{}

As people grow older, the radius of their eyes tends to decrease and the cornea itself takes on a more spherical shape.\cite{guirao2000optical}

\section{Aqueus Humor}

\section{The Lens}
After light passes through the cornea to the lens of the eye.

\section{Vitreous Humor}

The lens of the eye sits inside a bag with muscles attached to it which change
the focal length of the image which the light waves transmits.

\section{The Retina}
The retina is where light is changed from light waves into electrical signals
which we call brainwaves.

\section{Cones and Rods}

The function of cones and rods is to convert particular frequencies of light
waves
into electrical signals so that the brain can interpret what the eye has seen.
Whilst cones are not particularly sensitive to light, they do aid to visual
acuity.
\cite{}

A healthy/normal eye will pick up the full spectrum of colours.
\ref{fig:wavelengths} shows normalised absorbance against wavelength for red,
green and blue cones of the eye.

If all the eye cones are not working then this can cause
blindness to occur\cite{}
