\section{The Cornea of the Eye}

Light goes through front of eye via the cornea. 

\section{The Lens of the Eye}
After light passes through the cornea to the lens of the eye.

\section{The "Bag" of the Eye}
The lens of the eye sits inside a bag with muscles attached to it which change
the focal length of the image which the light waves transmits.

\section{The Retina of the Eye}
The retina is where light is changed from light waves into electrical signals
which we call brainwaves.

\section{Cones and Rods of the Eye}

Certain cones of the eye are sensitive to particular frequencies of light.
A healthy/normal eye will pick up the full spectrum of colours. Colour blindness
occurs when cones which are sensitive to specific frequencies are abnormal, this
is more common in men than women because [of something to do with the X
chromosome\cite{gardner2010x} \ref{fig:wavelengths} shows normalised absorbance
against wavelength for red, green and blue cones of the eye.

Cones are not particularly sensitive to light but they aid to visual acuity.
\cite{}

If all the eye cones are not working then this can cause
blindness to occur\cite{}
